%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

Adam Shaw has produced a great Web 2.0 Calendar UI, the jQuery !FullCalendar Plugin. This Foswiki plugin provides the backend calendar management code and the js/html interface ontop of the calendar UI for the creation and editing of calendar events.

%TOC%

---++ Features
As well as one-off events, repeating events can be created - daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, every n, every day-of-week, until end-date or no end-date. And exceptions can be created in repeating events.

The events from multiple calendars can be displayed on a single interface, and events can be saved to different calendars from a single interface. This means that a single user or group can define their own calendar that hooks into multiple calendars.

Multiple event types can be defined and selected from when creating a new event. The parameters of the selected type will be those as defined in the web of the selected calendar.

---
---++ The FULLCALENDAR macro
You can have multiple calendars per page and the macro can be called with or without parameters.
|*Parameter*|*Description*|*Default*|
|"..." or calendartopic="..."|Optional. A comma separated list of topics which will be searched for events to be displayed. Also defines a select list of calendars on the input form to which a new event can be saved. The format is "[&lt;web&gt;.]&lt;topic&gt;[,[&lt;web&gt;.]&lt;topic&gt;]".|WebCalendar|
|type="..."|Optional. A comma separated list of event types that can be created from the calendar interface. See Customisation below.|event|
|reltopic="..."|Optional. All objects managed by the ObjectPlugin _can_ have a reltopic parameter that points to a related &lt;web&gt;.&lt;topic&gt;, this is so that a single topic can act as the cache for all objects with the aim of helping performance. The !FullCalendarPlugin uses this feature.|If the current topic matches the specification of the calendartopic, then there is no specified reltopic. Else, reltopic is the current topic.|
|viewall="..."|Optional. 1 or 0. Depending on the setting of reltopic, all events stored in the calendartopic can be viewed or just the ones that match the reltopic setting.| |

---+++ Subscribing to multiple calendars
There must be many ways that the =calendartopic= parameter can be populated. One example is provided with this installation. The supplied FullCalendarForm defines two fields, !TopicType which is !FullCalendarTopic, and !SubscribedCalendars which provides a list of !FullCalendarTopic topics to choose from when editing. The FullCalendarViewTemplate populates the =calendartopic= parameter using the FORMFIELD macro, and the FullCalendarEditTemplate restricts editing to the form only where calendars can be subscribed to. This is embodied in WebCalendar.

---++ Creating and Editing Calendar Events
Just click on a day in the calendar to create a new event via the input form. Click on an existing event to edit its properties via the input form. If the selected event is part of a repeating sequence, the options are to:
   * Change this instance only (Create a new event)
   * Change all instances (Update the original event record)
   * Change all instances from this point onwards (Create a new event record)
   
*Note* that all newly created events will be done so with the matching =reltopic= setting.

If the =calendartopic= parameter has been defined in the macro, the user has the possibility of choosing the calendar to save to.

If the =type= parameter has been defined in the macro, the user has the possibility of choosing the type of event to create.

All events inherit the access controls of the calendar they belong to which means you may be able to see an event on the calendar but not edit it.

---++ The Calendar Event Object
The event attributes are defined in the EventObject topic. The default definition is in the =%<nop>SYSTEMWEB%=, but can be overridden by a new !EventObject in the =%<nop>USERSWEB%= and ultimately by one defined in the current web. See Customisation below.

---++ Other Event Sources
All Foswiki Macros defined in the =calendartopic= topic(s) are expanded. If they produce suitably formatted event records, these are then included in the displayed event set. *Note that a dynamic search could have a significant impact on performance when browsing the calendar.* The format should be as follows:
<verbatim>
%OBJECT{...}%<description>%ENDOBJECT%
</verbatim>
|*Parameter* |*Description* |*Default* |
|category="external"|Strongly recommended (Required) as these events will not be editable.| | 
|allDay="..."|Optional. 1 or 0. All day event or not.|If a startTime is not defined, then 1, else 0. |
|durationDays="..."|Optional. The number of days the event lasts for. Starts at 0.|0 |
|startDate="..."|Required. ISO8601 date format, YYYY-MM-DD.|This is the only hard criteria for an object to appear on a calendar, it must have a =startDate= parameter. |
|startTime="..."|Optional. ISO8601 time format, HH:MM:SS.| 00:00:00 |
|endTime="..."|Optional. ISO8601 time format, HH:MM:SS.| 00:00:00 |
|title="..."|Recommended.| 'no title' |
|url="..."|Optional. A URL to launch in a new tab/window if the event is clicked on the calendar.| |
|eventSource="..."|Optional. A text string defining the source of the event.| |

---++ Customisation
The EventObject and FullCalendarEventTemplate topics are provided as the default installation. View WebCalendar to see the result. As indicated above, you can create your own EventObject (in the =%<nop>USERSWEB%= for the whole site, or per web) with attributes relevant to your installation and in UserFullCalEventTemplate (in the =%<nop>USERSWEB%= for the whole site, or per web) you can customise the =FormElements:event= TMPL to match your new event object.

You can create multiple object types, e.g. !MyeventObject (note the formatting of the topic name, uppercase first letter and uppercase 'O' of 'Object' only), and then create respective !FormElements templates in UserFullCalEventTemplate, e.g. =FormElements:myevent= . For an event to appear on a calendar, it must have the =startDate= parameter, everything else is optional. See ObjectPlugin for information on defining new objects.

See the =FormElements:event= TMPL in FullCalendarEventTemplate for an example of how additional javascript can be included to control the behaviour of custom event elements on the input form. The following hooks are provided for triggering the actions:
   * =fcpLoadForm= - use for populating the custom form elements when an existing event is being loaded into the form,
   * =fcpCancelForm= - use to reset custom form elements when the form is closed,
   * =fcpEventAsObject= - triggered just before all the =class="urlParam"= parameters are collected into a js object for transmitting to the server.

---+++ User list
The default FullCalendarEventTemplate expects the =%USERGROUP%= variable to be set to a Group topic that gets parsed to provide a multi-select list of attendees. You can, off course, change this to be something else such as a free text field with auto-complete.

%X% Note, if you have a Foswiki 1.1.x installation, you are advised to add the following TMPL:DEF to UserFullCalEventTemplate to override the default template in FullCalendarEventTemplate.
<verbatim>
%TMPL:DEF{apptUserList}%<select multiple size="5" id="appt_users" name="users" class="userlist urlParam" resetmultiple="5">%GROUPINFO{"%USERGROUP%" format="<option value='$wikiname'>$percntSPACEOUT{$quot$wikiname$quot}$percnt" separator=" "}%</select>%TMPL:DEF%
</verbatim>

---++ Future Improvements

---+++ Integration with ActionTrackerPlugin 
This feature is already coded but currently commented out because it should be configurable via =configure= .

---+++ Agenda List View
The events displayed on the calendar will also be displayed in a chronological list.
